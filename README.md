# UFOs
Create a customized html page with a table and article reporting findings of UFO sightings.

## Purpose
We have been assisting our customer, Dana, with creating a webpage and dynamic table to reporting UFO sightings which have been reported. Dana requested further assistance for a more in-depth analysis of these UFO sightings. Dana's request would allow users to filter the tables by city, state, country, and shape. This gives users the ability to search through the data by using more column headers, providing a more in-depth analysis.

### Objectives
The primary goals to accomplish Dana's new request include:
- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional filters.
- Update and deploy forEach function to loop through and update the filters with user unput.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

Our resources included JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
